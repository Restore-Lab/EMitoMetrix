# EMitoMetrix

EMito-Metrix is a high-performance pipeline for analyzing mitochondrial morphology and the ultrastructure in multiple tissues from low to high resolution images acquired with Electron microscopy (EM). Interface allows to compute a set of morphometrics and texture measurements, and provides a list of graphs for optimizing data visualization using dimensionality reduction (UMAP or PCA) and more conventional depiction of data distribution (density curves, histograms, violin plots or star plots). Additionally, a machine learning (ML) module with predictive analytic tools allows to determine how any given experimental condition would impact on mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure

EMito-Metrix plugin was written by Mathieu Vigneau, Emmanuel Doumard and Jean-Philippe Prad√®re from the [RESTORE](https://restore-lab.fr/en/home-en/) Institute.

The software is available in different versions :
